# Orthweb - Orthanc in Docker on AWS
 
## Overview

**[Orthanc](https://www.orthanc-server.com/)** is an open-source application to ingest, store, display and distribute medical images. **[Orthweb](https://github.com/hmesha/orthweb)** is an open-source project to automatically configure Orthanc and associated resource on AWS. It configures Orthanc in 10 minutes. When the deployment is completed, the website is ready to serve both web and DICOM traffic.

We use Terraform to create infrastructure on AWS, including VPC, subnets, secret manager, managed database (PostgreSQL), an EC2 instance and S3 bucket. The application is hosted in a Docker container on the EC2 instance.

## Production Use

Orthweb project demonstrates the idea of infrastructure-as-code, deployment automation and security configurations in compliance with HIPPA. It provisions just enough resources for demo, and it is not intended for production use. A solution for production and clinical use requires a holistic planning for scalability, high availability, disaster recovery, security compliance etc, as well as custom implementation. Please contact [Digi Hunch](https://www.hmesha.com/) for professional IT service.

## Prerequisite

Users need their own AWS account (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key with administrator privilege) to deploy this project.  The rest of this instruction is based on local execution of Terraform command from MacOS. Make sure **awscli** is configured and **Terraform CLI** is [installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli). There are more than one methods to authenticate Terraform against AWS.  The easiest [setup](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#shared-credentials-file) is to use the [credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) for [awscli]((https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)). To connect to the server console, it is also required to [configure](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001736671-Creating-a-new-Key-pair-in-Mac-OS-X-or-Linux) an SSH key pair. 

## Deployment

From command terminal, go to the [terraform](https://github.com/hmesha/orthweb/tree/main/terraform) directory and execute Terraform command from there.
1. Initialize terraform modules, and plan for deployment, with command:

> terraform init && terraform plan

This command will initialize Terraform template (e.g. download AWS provider) and then plan out the resources to deploy. It should print out the resources about to deploy.

3. Execute the deployment plan, by running:

> terraform apply

In this step Terraform interact with your AWS account to provision the resources and configure the website, which can take as long as 15 minutes. Upon successful deployment, the output displays three entries:
* **hostinfo**: the EC2 host information in the format of ec2-user@ec2-102-203-105-112.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	* ec2-user is the username to SSH to server, refer to advanced validation below for how to connect to the server.
	* The part after the "@" sign is the website FQDN. Refer to basic validation below for how to visit the site.
* **dbinfo**: the PostgreSQL URL and port, in the format of postgresdbinstance.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432, only accessible with appropriate permissions;
* **s3bucket**: the URL to the S3 bucket created in the format of bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com, only accessible with appropriate permissions;

Now that site is up, we can validate the site with the steps outlined in the sections below. Once your demo is completed, you may remove all the resources, with command:
> terraform destroy

## Basic Validation

To Validate DICOM capability, we can test with C-ECHO and C-STORE. We can use any DICOM compliant application. For example, [Horos](https://horosproject.org/) on MacOS is a UI-based application. In Preference->Locations, configure a new DICOM nodes with
* Address: the site FQDN
* AE title: ORTHANC
* Port: 11112 (or otherwise configured)

Remember to enable TLS. Then you will be able to verify the node (i.e. C-ECHO) and send existing studies from Horos to Orthanc (C-STORE).

To Validate the the web server, simply visit the website with the default credential. For example, https://ec2-102-203-105-112.compute-1.amazonaws.com:443. The web browser might flag the site as insecure with invalid authority. This is due to the use of self-signed certificate in the demo. In a production deployment, you should bring your own DNS name with matching SSL certificate so that web browser will recognize it as secure. 

The basic validation steps are carried out from the perspective of end user. In the next section, I provide some guidelines for advanced validation from the point of IT professional. For application validation, you will need an imaging informatics professional. 

## Advanced Validation
The advanced validation is carried out in four perspectives: Hosting server, DICOM connectivity, Database and Storage. 

### Server Validation
We use SSH protocol with [RSA key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) authentication to connect to EC2 instance. The terraform template in this project requires public key provided to the input variable named pubkey_data. It uses the key content from  local public key file (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub). If you prefers explicitly use a different public key data, you can provide it as environment variable before running apply command:
```sh
export TF_VAR_pubkey_data="fakepublickeyabcxyzpubkklsss"
terraform plan
```
This technique is for the convenience of tester, because as the server is provisioned, the user will be able to SSH to the server with a simple SSH command:
```sh
ssh ec2-user@ec2-user@ec2-102-203-105-112.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```
Once logged on, we can check cloud init log:
```sh
sudo tail -F /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```
Which should say Orthanc has started. The files related to Orthanc deployment are in directory /home/ec2-user/orthweb/app:
* orthanc.json: the Orthanc configuration file
* envoy.yaml: the Envoy configuration file
* compute-1.amazonaws.com.pem: the file that stores the self-signed certificate and key that are generated for deployment.
* docker-compose.yml: the file that drives Docker

### DICOM Validation
We will use a command-line utility called [dcm4che3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dcm4che/files/dcm4che3/) for DICOM testing. Because Orthanc requires TLS with DICOM traffic, and dcm4che is a Java application, we will also need to pull out the automatically generated certificate and convert it to a compatible (JKS) format for dcm4che to use.
1. On the server, from the .pem file in /home/ec2-user/orthweb/app/, copy the certificate content (between the lines "BEGIN CERTIFICATE" and "END CERTIFICATE" inclusive), and paste it to a file named site.crt on your MacBook.
2. Import the certificate file int a java trust store, with the command below and give it a password, say Password123!
```sh
keytool -import -alias orthweb -file site.crt -storetype JKS -noprompt -keystore server.truststore -storepass Password123!
```
The server.truststore file is JKS format for storescu, the dcm4che utility in Java, to use in the next step.

3. Then we can use this truststore file in C-ECHO and C-STORE. The dcm4che3 utility uses storescu to perform C-ECHO against the server. For example:
```sh
./storescu -c ORTHANC@ec2-102-203-105-112.compute-1.amazonaws.com:11112 --tls12 --tls-aes --trust-store server.truststore --trust-store-pass Password123!
```
The output should read Status code 0 in C-ECHO-RSP, followed by C-ECHO-RQ. For example, the output should contain some important lines such as:
```
23:21:27,506 INFO  - STORESCU->ORTHANC(1) << 1:C-ECHO-RQ[pcid=1
  cuid=1.2.840.10008.1.1 - Verification SOP Class

```
4. We can use it to store DICOM part 10 file (usually .dcm extension) to the server, using storescu again:
```sh
./storescu -c ORTHANC@ec2-102-203-105-112.compute-1.amazonaws.com:11112 --tls12 --tls-aes --trust-store server.truststore --trust-store-pass Password123! MYFILE.DCM
```
The output log should contain the following:
```

```
C-STORE-RSP status 0 indicates successful image transfer, and the image is viewable from web portal. 

### Database Validation

RDS will be accessible from the EC2 instance, on port 5432. The database URL and password can be retrieved using AWS CLI command. Their values are also kept in file /home/ec2-user/.orthanc.env during initialization. To validate by psql client, run:
```sh
psql --host=postgresdbinstance.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com --port 5432 --username=myuser --dbname=orthancdb
```
Then you are in the PostgreSQL command console and can check the tables using SQL, for example:
```sh
orthancdb=> \dt;
                List of relations
 Schema |         Name          | Type  | Owner
--------+-----------------------+-------+--------
 public | attachedfiles         | table | myuser
 public | changes               | table | myuser
 public | deletedfiles          | table | myuser
 public | deletedresources      | table | myuser
 public | dicomidentifiers      | table | myuser
 public | exportedresources     | table | myuser
 public | globalintegers        | table | myuser
 public | globalproperties      | table | myuser
 public | maindicomtags         | table | myuser
 public | metadata              | table | myuser
 public | patientrecyclingorder | table | myuser
 public | remainingancestor     | table | myuser
 public | resources             | table | myuser
 public | serverproperties      | table | myuser
(14 rows)

orthancdb=> select * from attachedfiles;
 id | filetype |                 uuid                 | compressedsize | uncompressedsize | compressiontype |         uncompressedhash         |          compressedhash          | revision
----+----------+--------------------------------------+----------------+------------------+-----------------+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+----------
  4 |        1 | 87719ef0-cbb1-4249-a0ac-e68356d97a7a |         525848 |           525848 |               1 | bd07bf5f2f1287da0f0038638002e9b1 | bd07bf5f2f1287da0f0038638002e9b1 |        0
(1 row)
```
You may not be able to interpret the content without the database schema. It is also not recommended to edit the tables directly bypassing the application logic.

### Storage Validation

Storage validation can be performed simply by examining the content of S3 bucket. If S3 integration is turned on, once studies are sent to Orthanc, the corresponding DICOM file should appear in the S3 bucket. For example, we can run the following AWS CLI command from the EC2 instance:
```sh
aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name
2021-12-02 18:54:41     525848 87719ef0-cbb1-4249-a0ac-e68356d97a7a.dcm
```
The bucket is not publicly assissible and is protected by bucket policy configured during resource provisioning.


## Custom Orthanc image Builder

The open-source Orthanc project does not include the plugin for storing images on S3 bucket. So I use custom Orthanc image based on [Osimis Orthanc image](https://hub.docker.com/r/osimis/orthanc), if S3 integration is turned on. 

This project also includes the builder for Digi Hunch [custom Orthanc image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/hmesha/orthanc) in the *build* directory. I use Github Action to build and push the image to my Docker registry. 

The EC2 initialization script automatically apply the configuration for the Orthanc image and Orthanc.json files, based on whether UseS3Storage variable is set to true.


##  Architecture

The architecture can be illustrated in the diagram below:

![Diagram](resources/Orthweb.png)

Orthweb is built on AWS as cloud platform, and uses Docker on EC2 to host application. The alternative to EC2 is ECS but ECS has some [limitations](https://github.com/hmesha/orthweb/issues/1#issuecomment-852669561). Docker on EC2 is sufficient for typical imaging workload. [This](https://ably.com/blog/no-we-dont-use-kubernetes) blog discusses how Docker on EC2 in Autoscaling group suits the need of most workloads without the complexity of Kubernetes. Orthweb has a sibling project [Korthweb](https://github.com/hmesha/korthweb) under development, which deploys Orthanc on Kubernetes platform.

|            | Orthweb Demo                 | Korthweb Demo                        |
|------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| App        | Docker on EC2                | Kubernetes                           |
| Database   | Managed PostgreSQL           | Managed PostgresSQL or custom design |
| Storage    | Managed PostgreSQL or S3     | Managed PostgreSQL or Object storage |
| Networking | Vanilla Setup                | Vanilla Setup                        |
| HA/DR      | N/A. requiring custom design to add Load Balancer and AutoScaling | N/A, requiring custom design         |

Originally, Orthanc did not support DICOM traffic over TLS. So Orthweb used Nginx as a reverse proxy to terminate TLS traffic. Now Orthanc does have DICOM TLS support but it is not straightforward to configure. Orthweb also uses Envoy proxy instead of Nginx for better performance. Envoy acts as reverse proxy for both web traffic (https->https) and DICOM traffic (dicom tls -> dicom), with static configuration.

Orthweb use PostgreSQL database backend, even though it supports many kinds of databases. The PostgreSQL can be used to index patient data only, or store pixel data as well. The other way to store pixel data is to use the S3 bucket using the custom built S3 plugin.

## Security

Despite of a demo project, Orthweb project takes security seriously for HIPPA compliance. It uses self-signed certificate in the demo but in production deployment it should be replaced with certificates signed by CA. Below are the points of configurations for security compliance:

1. Both DICOM and web traffic are encrypted in TLS. This requires peer DICOM AE to support DICOM TLS in order to connect with Orthanc.
2. PostgreSQL data is encrypted at rest, and the database traffic between Orthanc application and database is encrypted in SSL.
3. The S3 bucket has server side encryption. The traffic in transit between S3 bucket and Orthanc application is encrypted as well.
4. The password for database are generated dynamically and stored in AWS Secret Manager in AWS. The EC2 instance is granted access to the secret, which allows the cloud-init script to fetch the secret and launch container with it. 
5. The demo-purpose self-signed X509 certificate is dynamically generated using openssl11 during bootstrapping, in compliance with [Mac requirement](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210176).

The handling of secret at some points of configurations has room for improvement.
1. Database password is generated at Terraform client and then sent to deployment server to create PostgreSQL. The generated password is also stored in state file of Terraform. To overcome this, we need a) Terraform tells AWS secrets manager to generate a password; and b) it tells other AWS service to resolve the newly created secret. As of May 2021, a) is doable but b) isn't due to a limitation with Terraform
2. Secret management with Docker container: secret are presented to container process as environment variables, instead of file content. As per [this article](https://techbeacon.com/devops/how-keep-your-container-secrets-secure), this is not the best practice.
